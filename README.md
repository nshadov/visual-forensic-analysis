# visual-forensic-analysis

Set of helpers to visualize relations between events over time.

Main workhorse used is [Gephi](https://gephi.org/) - leading visualization and exploration software. Gephi expects graphs and that's not always thing you carry
around with yourself (in contrast to CSV, JSON, etc). Those helpers would help you to leverage Gephi nonetheless to understand relations and explain sequence of events to someone.

# Requirements
